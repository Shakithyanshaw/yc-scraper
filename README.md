I used Playwright to scrape the Y Combinator startup directory by dynamically scrolling the listings page to collect approximately 500 unique company profile URLs. Each company profile was then visited individually to extract company details and founder information, including LinkedIn URLs when available. The script is modular, handles dynamic content loading, and outputs the final dataset as a CSV file.
